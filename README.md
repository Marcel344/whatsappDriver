Ever wanted to send text messages to hundreds of poeple but never find the time to do so ? Well i'm here to save your time, with this software, you'll be able to send messages to as many people as you like, you could also send images with text and include every contact's name in the message. You can also send messages to a specified group of poeple by specifying a CSV file with the contact names (The contact names must be exact). For a quickstart just go into Unix or Windows folder (depending on your OS) and run pip3 install -r Requirements.txt to install the libraries.

### I recommend taking a look at these presentations i made before using the software : 

Keynote (MacOS) : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qW96zUVQavnoc-7xsfTYARvh8FOkLD0S/view?usp=sharing

## Few Things you should know before you use the program :

- Once the program starts and the whatsapp website is loaded, first thing to do is to scan to QR, after you logged in to the main page you can start the program, if you press start and the you still haven’t logged in with the QR yet, the program will crash.
Keep the website on the foreground, do not minimize the website when the program is running, because some key HTML elements will get hidden which will result in a crash.
- Do not press on anything when the program is running, it will disrupt the flow of execution and result in a crash.
- Once the program finished sending the messages, you’ll have to rerun it to start forwarding another message.
- In case the internet timed out at runtime, the program will pause the forwarder and will resume automatically from where it paused when the internet is back.
- I recommend always checking the preview mode before actually sending the message.
- If you want to clear the records that are stored in the program find the records folder inside the program’s directory and delete any record you want from there.
